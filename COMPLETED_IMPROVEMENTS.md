## 📊 Summary of Changes

### Files Modified: 8
### New Files Created: 3
### Lines of Code Added: ~250
### Code Quality: ✅ No Linting Errors

---

## 1️⃣ Centralized URL Generation

### What Was Changed

**Modified Files:**
- ✅ `core/utils.py` - Added `get_image_url()` function
- ✅ `sofahub_backend/settings.py` - Added `SITE_URL` configuration
- ✅ `products/serializers.py` - Using centralized function
- ✅ `products/admin.py` - Using centralized function (2 places)
- ✅ `cart/serializers.py` - Using centralized function
- ✅ `blog/serializers.py` - Using centralized configuration

### Before (Hardcoded):
```python
# ❌ Duplicated in 5+ files
if settings.DEBUG:
    return f"http://localhost:8000/api/images/{obj.id}/"
else:
    return f"https://sofahubbackend-production.up.railway.app/api/images/{obj.id}/"
```

### After (Centralized):
```python
# ✅ Single line everywhere
from core.utils import get_image_url
return get_image_url(obj.id, request)
```

### Configuration:
```python
# settings.py
SITE_URL = os.getenv('SITE_URL', 
    'http://localhost:8000' if DEBUG 
    else 'https://sofahubbackend-production.up.railway.app'
)
```

## 2️⃣ Image Validation System

### What Was Added

**New Functions in `core/utils.py`:**
- ✅ `validate_image_file_size()` - Max 5MB
- ✅ `validate_image_file_type()` - JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP only
- ✅ `validate_image_dimensions()` - Min 300×200px, Max 4000×4000px
- ✅ `validate_product_image()` - Combined validator

**Modified:**
- ✅ `products/models.py` - Added `clean()` and modified `save()` in ProductImage

### Validation Rules:

| Check | Rule | Error Message Example |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| **File Size** | ≤ 5 MB | "Image file size cannot exceed 5MB. Current size: 8.00MB" |
| **File Type** | .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp | "Unsupported file extension: .pdf" |
| **Min Size** | ≥ 300×200 px | "Image dimensions too small. Minimum: 300x200px, Got: 100x100px" |
| **Max Size** | ≤ 4000×4000 px | "Image dimensions too large. Maximum: 4000x4000px" |
| **Integrity** | Valid image file | "File is not a valid image or is corrupted" |

### How It Works:

```python
# Automatically validates on upload
class ProductImage(models.Model):
    # ... fields ...
    
    def clean(self):
        """Validate image before saving"""
        if self.image:
            from core.utils import validate_product_image
            validate_product_image(self.image)
    
    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Override save to call full_clean()"""
        self.full_clean()  # Triggers validation
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

---

## 3️⃣ Consistent Context Passing

### What Was Verified/Added

**Verified All Views Pass Request Context:**
- ✅ `products/views.py`:
  - `ProductList` - ✅ Added `get_serializer_context()`
  - `ProductDetail` - ✅ Already had context passing
  - `product_images()` function - ✅ Already had context passing
  
- ✅ `cart/views.py`:
  - `CartDetail` - ✅ Already had context passing
  - `add_to_cart()` - ✅ Already had context passing
  - `update_cart_item()` - ✅ Already had context passing
  - `remove_from_cart()` - ✅ Already had context passing
  
- ✅ `blog/views.py`:
  - `BlogPostList` - ✅ Already had context passing
  - `BlogPostDetail` - ✅ Already had context passing

### Code Pattern:

```python
class SomeView(generics.ListAPIView):
    # ...
    
    def get_serializer_context(self):
        """Ensure request context is passed"""
        context = super().get_serializer_context()
        context['request'] = self.request
        return context
```

## 📁 New Files Created

### 1. `IMAGE_HANDLING_SUMMARY.md`
Comprehensive documentation of how image upload and serving works (338 lines)

### 2. `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
Detailed documentation of all improvements made (400+ lines)

### 3. `products/management/commands/test_image_validation.py`
Test command to verify all validation and URL generation works

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Command Created:
```bash
python manage.py test_image_validation
```

### What It Tests:
1. ✅ URL generation with/without request context
2. ✅ File size validation (rejects files > 5MB)
3. ✅ File type validation (rejects non-images)
4. ✅ Dimension validation (rejects too small/large images)
5. ✅ Valid image acceptance

### Code Quality:
```bash
# Linting check passed
✓ core/utils.py
✓ products/models.py  
✓ products/views.py
✓ products/serializers.py
✓ cart/serializers.py
✓ blog/serializers.py
✓ products/admin.py
✓ sofahub_backend/settings.py

Result: 0 linting errors
```
